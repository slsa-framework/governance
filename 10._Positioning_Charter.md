# Positioning SIG Charter

## Mission
- Educate the open source community, global industry, and standards/regulatory bodies on SLSA
- Evangelize SLSA to increase adoption
- Evaluate SLSA to other frameworks, standards, or regulations
- Encourage participation to obtain diverse perspectives, further improving SLSA

## Vision
Obtain industry wide adoption and recognition, for public/private sectors, of SLSA as the “lingua franca” for producing software and ensuring a secure software supply chain.  

## Values
Please see Code of Conduct for more information: https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md

## Strategy

### Evaluate
When evaluating SLSA compared to other standards/frameworks/regulations, we will aim to answer one or more of the following questions: 
- Should SLSA increase/decrease scope?
- How does SLSA work with other frameworks? 
- Is there overlap in SLSA with other frameworks?
- Are there deficiencies or out of scope items in SLSA with relation to other frameworks?
- Are there use cases/personas to address that were not considered in SLSA?

Community Members may leverage one or more of the following mediums to perform evaluations:  
- Google Doc/Spreadsheet
- GitHub Issue
- Whiteboarding Application (i.e. Mural, etc.) 

After evaluations are performed, this SIG will take a position on its impacts for SLSA and organizations.

### Educate/Evangelize
Purpose of education is to highlight the benefits that can be gained by using SLSA. Additionally, positioning SIG members may highlight the current/future work, and where the community is needing help.  When educating the open source community, global industry, and standards/regulatory bodies on SLSA, we will aim to perform one or more of the following:

- Educate organizations on how SLSA compares to other frameworks, regulations, or standards
- Educate organizations of how to apply SLSA to their use cases
- Educate organizations on out-of-scope items for SLSA
- Educate standards/regulatory bodies on how SLSA fits or fills in deficiencies in standards/regulations, by referencing the comparative evaluations performed.
- Educate other open source communities on how to leverage SLSA to improve code quality/security via self-elected workstream or via an existing initiative (i.e. OpenSSF WG - Critical Software)

Community Members may leverage one or more of the following mediums:  
- SLSA Blog (see Contribution Guidelines for more info)
- SLSA Slack Channels (see Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct)
- SLSA/OpenSSF/Community Meetings
- OpenSSF/Linux Foundation Slack/Social Media accounts (See Respective Contributions Guidelines)
- Personal Social Media accounts (i.e. LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- Conferences (i.e. Presentations, Lightning talks, Hallway talks, etc.)

### Encourage
By performing the previously stated missions, we should encourage participation from the broader community/industry to obtain diverse perspectives, which will in turn improve SLSA. By encouraging participation with diverse perspectives, it may help us with:

- Identifying new use cases 
- Identifying new personas
- Identifying opportunities for SLSA expansion
- Identifying opportunities for shifting SLSA strategy/scope
- Enabling additional OpenSSF participation
- Improving security of our open source communities/industry

## Operating Goals
In addition to the Collaboration/Workstream process documented in [SLSA SIGs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L1gEJMBIvE0IbpFi23FOUByDYlItSYPPJmKdhvJQYsg/edit#heading=h.1hce59kd4nn0), the following are our short term/long term goals:

Short Term 
- Evaluate SLSA in relation to NIST SSDF, NIST SP800-161r1, SBOM, EO14028, CNCF
- Educate community on findings
- Evangelize how SLSA fits/overlaps/fills in gaps of these frameworks
- Encourage additional participation for current & future evaluations

Longer Term
- Evaluate SLSA with more of NIST portfolio (i.e. NIST 800-53r5), CISA Common Criteria, CIS Benchmark for Supply Chain Security, CD Foundation, and emerging ex-US standards and regulations.
- Provide SLSA Specification feedback to improve use cases, personas, applicability, and trustworthiness.  

## Leadership / Accountability
In addition to the Schedule/Collaboration/Workstream process documented in [SLSA SIGs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L1gEJMBIvE0IbpFi23FOUByDYlItSYPPJmKdhvJQYsg/edit#heading=h.1hce59kd4nn0), SIG leaders will drive weekly sessions to execute towards our goals.

Bi-weekly positioning SIG meeting with all members.  The goal of this meeting is to discuss:
- Roadmap/Vision
- Status Updates
- Enabling a forum for new ideas

Bi-weekly Working session with subset of members (any and all are available to join).  The goal of this meeting is to discuss:
- Tactical approaches for completing work
- Actively work on ideas/goals
- Brainstorming on a particular goal/mission.

For additional accountability, positioning SIG Leaders will present our current efforts in the following forums:
- Bi-weekly SLSA meeting
- Bi-weekly Supply Chain Integrity Working Group meeting
