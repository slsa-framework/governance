# SLSA Governance

This repo contains documents that describe the governance practices for the Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) Project.

The SLSA Project oversees development of the SLSA materials in the [SLSA GitHub org](https://github.com/slsa-framework). Specifications developed by the SLSA Project are developed in their own repositories, and are subject to the licensing and governance policies described in this repo.

The SLSA Governance process is based on the [Community Specification model and license](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/1.0) from the [Joint Development Foundation](https://www.jointdevelopment.org).
